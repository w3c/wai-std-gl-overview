## Translation Notes

### Links to WCAG standards

The page contains links to WCAG 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2.

If an Authorized Translation of a WCAG standard has been published in your language, please point to the translated version.

Example:

```
- [Le standard WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/Translations/WCAG20-fr/)
- [Le standard WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/Translations/WCAG21-fr/)
```

If not, translate the link text but keep the link to the English version.

Example:

```
- [Le standard WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22//)
```

For now, it is OK to leave the image in English. (It only illustrates the information above, and does not provided substantial additional information.) We are working on an SVG version of that image, with support for translation. We will update this section and notify existing translators when it is ready.
